# Text Analysis and Sentiment Prediction Repository

Welcome to the Text Analysis and Sentiment Prediction Repository! This repository contains code and resources for analyzing text data and predicting sentiment using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models.

## Data Folder
The `data` folder contains the datasets used for text analysis and sentiment prediction. Make sure to upload your datasets here before running the code.

## Preprocessing
Before training the sentiment prediction model, we perform preprocessing on the text data to clean and prepare it for analysis. This includes steps such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and handling special characters.

## Model Building
We use LSTM neural networks to build a sentiment prediction model. LSTM networks are well-suited for processing sequential data like text due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.

## Code Structure
- `preprocessing.py`: Contains code for text preprocessing.
- `model.py`: Defines the LSTM model architecture.
- `train.py`: Trains the LSTM model on the preprocessed text data.
- `app.py`: Uses the trained model to predict sentiment for new text inputs.

## Usage
1. Upload your datasets to the `data` folder.
2. Run `preprocessing.py` to preprocess the text data.
3. Run `model.py` to train the LSTM model on the preprocessed data.
4. Use `app.py` to predict sentiment for new text inputs using the trained model.

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the text analysis or sentiment prediction process, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Happy Text Analysis and Sentiment Prediction!
